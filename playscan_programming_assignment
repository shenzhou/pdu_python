Programming Assignment

Write a Python program that reads a sequence of mathematical expressions from a file and prints the
result of evaluating all expressions in the order they appear. The file consists of a series of expressions,
one per line. Each line is in the format “function <value>”. ADD 5, for example, adds 5 to the current
value. The initial value when the program starts is 0. A file contains maximum ten rows.
The following functions shall be supportedjj :

ADD (addition, +)
SUB (subtraction, ­)
MUL (multiplication, *)
DIV (division, /)
SQR (square, ^2) ­ without value

Executing
python yourprogram example.file
should print “9”, where example.file is listed below.

ADD 5
ADD 7
SUB 9
SQR

We don't expect this task to be challenging. Rather, we are interested in your style. If you don't feel
comfortable with Python, feel free to use another language.
